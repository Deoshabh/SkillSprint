# SkillSprint Platform Audit Report

**Date of Audit:** {{TODAY_DATE_ISO}} (Simulated)
**Auditor:** AI Prototyper

This report outlines the findings from a simulated audit of the SkillSprint platform based on the `PLATFORM_AUDIT_PLAN.md` and a review of the generated codebase.

## Overall Summary:

The SkillSprint platform has a wide range of features implemented, covering user authentication, course interaction, content creation (manual and AI-assisted), user engagement (notes, planner, gamification), and administrative tools. Most core functionalities are in place as per the specifications, with the primary limitations being:

1.  **Data Persistence:** Relies on `localStorage` for user data and `placeholder-data.ts` for shared content. This is suitable for a prototype but not for a production environment.
2.  **Placeholder Features:** Some features, like detailed analytics and full broadcast messaging delivery, are currently UI placeholders.
3.  **Security:** Admin route protection is client-side; a backend solution would be needed for robust security.
4.  **Error Handling:** While basic error toasts are present, comprehensive error boundaries (`error.js` in Next.js) could be more extensively implemented.
5.  **Accessibility & Responsiveness:** While generally good due to ShadCN and Tailwind, thorough manual testing across devices and with accessibility tools is recommended for production.

## Detailed Findings:

### I. Core User Flow & Authentication

1.  **User Signup (`/signup`)**
    *   **Status:** Pass (with prototype assumptions)
    *   **Observations:** New user signup works, `profileSetupComplete` set to `false`. User redirected to `/profile-setup`. Toast for success shown.
    *   **Bugs/Issues:** Invalid/missing field validation is basic HTML5 `required`.
2.  **User Login (`/login`)**
    *   **Status:** Pass (with prototype assumptions)
    *   **Observations:** Login works. Redirects to `/profile-setup` if incomplete, `/dashboard` if complete. Toast for success shown.
    *   **Bugs/Issues:** Incorrect credentials show a generic toast; specific error messages could be improved.
3.  **Profile Setup (`/profile-setup`)**
    *   **Status:** Pass
    *   **Observations:** Role, tracks, language selection saved to user profile. `profileSetupComplete` set to `true`. Redirects to `/dashboard`. Toast shown. Redirects away if profile already complete.
4.  **Logout**
    *   **Status:** Pass
    *   **Observations:** User logged out, `localStorage` cleared (simulated by `AuthContext`). Redirects to `/`.

    *   All flows appear to be correctly integrated and provide expected outputs within their respective UI features.

### V. General Platform Aspects

1.  **Responsiveness**
    *   **Status:** Needs Manual Verification
    *   **Observations:** Based on ShadCN and Tailwind, basic responsiveness is expected. Sidebar has mobile handling. Thorough testing on various devices is required.
2.  **Theme Toggle (Light/Dark Mode)**
    *   **Status:** Pass
    *   **Observations:** `next-themes` is implemented, and `globals.css` defines light/dark theme variables. UI elements adapt correctly.
3.  **Toast Notifications**
    *   **Status:** Pass
    *   **Observations:** `useToast` is consistently used for user feedback (success, error) across features.
4.  **Error Handling**
    *   **Status:** Partial Pass
    *   **Observations:** Client-side validation (e.g., required fields) exists. AI flows show error toasts. General application-wide error boundaries (`error.js`) are not explicitly implemented beyond Next.js defaults.
    *   **Suggestions:** Consider adding segment-specific `error.js` files for more graceful error recovery in different parts of the app.
5.  **Security (Admin Route Protection)**
    *   **Status:** Partial Pass (Prototype Level)
    *   **Observations:** Admin routes and features perform client-side checks for `user.role === 'admin'`.
    *   **Bugs/Issues:** This is not sufficient for production. Backend route protection or Next.js middleware would be necessary for true security.
6.  **Accessibility (Basic Checks)**
    *   **Status:** Partial Pass / Needs Review
    *   **Observations:** Keyboard navigation for ShadCN components is generally good.
    *   **Suggestions:** Review for consistent `alt` text on all images (especially placeholders or user-uploaded). Ensure all interactive elements (icon buttons) have `aria-label` or sufficient context. A more thorough accessibility audit using tools like Axe or Lighthouse is recommended.

## Priority List for Fixes/Improvements (Post-Prototype):

1.  **Backend Integration:** Replace `localStorage` and `placeholder-data.ts` with a proper backend database for all data persistence (users, courses, progress, notes, sketches, feedback, etc.).
2.  **Robust Security:** Implement backend-enforced route protection and permissions for admin functionalities.
3.  **Full Feature Implementation:** Develop backend logic for features currently using placeholders (Analytics data fetching, Broadcast Messaging delivery system).
4.  **Enhanced Error Handling:** Implement `error.js` boundaries for key application segments.
5.  **Accessibility Audit & Fixes:** Conduct a thorough accessibility review and address any identified issues.
6.  **Responsiveness Testing:** Manually test across a range of devices and browsers.
7.  **Refine UI/UX:** Address minor UI inconsistencies or areas for improvement based on user testing.
8.  **PDF Viewer Integration:** Implement a proper PDF viewing solution for PDF module content type.
9.  **Quiz Engine:** Develop the actual quiz taking and scoring mechanism for quiz module content type.

This report provides a snapshot of the platform's status based on the current codebase. The platform is feature-rich for a prototype and forms a strong foundation for further development.
